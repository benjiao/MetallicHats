# Metallic Hats
A hi-hat drum synthesizer module using six square wave oscillators.


## Version History

**Version 1.1**

In this version, I added a DIY vactrol to replace the decay pot. This allows me to control decay through a sequencer. Trim and offset pots are added to control maximum and minimum decay.
