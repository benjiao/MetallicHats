# Metallic Hats
by Benjie Jiao

## Version History

**[Version 1.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benjiao/MetallicHats/master/Exports/MetallicHats%20v1.1.svg)**

In this version, I added a DIY vactrol to replace the decay pot. This allows me to control decay through a sequencer. Trim and offset pots are added to control maximum and minimum decay.
